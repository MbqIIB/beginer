Cookbook:iptables

Sets up iptables to use a script to maintain firewall rules.

1.Requirements:
   Platform:
           Ubuntu/Debian
           RHEL/CentOS

2.Recipes:default
    The default recipe will install iptables and provides a ruby script (installed in /usr/sbin/rebuild-iptables) to manage rebuilding firewall 
    rules from files dropped off in /etc/iptables.d.

3.Definitions:
   i)iptables_rule:-
       This definition drops off a template in /etc/iptables.d after the name parameter. The rule will get added to the local system firewall 
       through notifying the rebuild-iptables.

4.Attributes:
    default["iptables"]["install_rules"] = true  # install the default rules and this value is true by default

5.Usage:
   Examples: To enable port 80, e.g. in an httpd cookbook, create the following template inside the default folder of the template directory 
             and name it http.erb. Here is the iptable rule of the http.erb file:-
               
                    -A FWR -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
          
             Then to use this rule add a line like this in the default recipe of the httpd cookbook

                     iptables_rule "http"
