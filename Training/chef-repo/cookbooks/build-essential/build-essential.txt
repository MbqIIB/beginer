Cookbook:build-essential
  This cookbook installs packages required for compiling C software from source. We use this cookbook if we wish to compile C programs, or 
  install RubyGems with native extensions.

1.Recipes:-
  This cookbook contains various recipes according to platform. For example the debian recipe consists of the various packages that will be 
  installed in the system such as 
                 package 'autoconf'
                 package 'binutils-doc'
                 package 'bison'
                 package 'build-essential'
                 package 'flex'
                 package 'gettext'
                 package 'ncurses-dev'


2.Attributes:-
  default['build-essential']['compile_time'] - This attribute execute resources at compile time and the default is false
 

Usage:-
  a)By default the build essential will install all the recipes such as _debian,_fedora,_freebsd,_rhel etc. So if have know that our nodes are   
    only let us suppose debian based and want only _debian recipe should be included in the chef-server then we have our metadata.json file like 
    this.

{
  "name": "build-essential",
  "version": "2.0.6",
  "description": "Installs C compiler / build tools",
   ...........
   ...........
 "platforms": {
     "debian": ">= 0.0.0"
}
 "recipes": {
    "build-essential": "_debian"
  }
}

 b)if we want to add or remove some packages in the particular recipe then the only thing which we want to do is to remove or add the package 
   from the recipe.
