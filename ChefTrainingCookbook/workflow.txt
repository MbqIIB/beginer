It looks long and dense, but each directory has some meaning to Test Kitchen and the Busser helper:

test/integration: Test Kitchen will look for tests to run under this directory. It allows you to put unit or other tests in test/unit, spec, acceptance, or wherever without mixing them up. This is configurable, if desired.
default: This corresponds exactly to the Suite name we set up in the .kitchen.yml file. If we had a suite called "server-only", then you would put tests for the server only suite under test/integration/server-only.
bats: This tells Test Kitchen (and Busser) which Busser runner plugin needs to be installed on the remote instance. In other words the bats directory name will cause Busser to install busser-bats from RubyGems.



Write your test for testing binaries
 

Create serverspec test
mkdir -p test/integration/default/serverspec

create a spec_helper.rb file 
require 'serverspec'
set :backend, :exec

Create your test. Crate file, port, service based test.
